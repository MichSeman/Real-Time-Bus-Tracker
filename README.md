# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
## Ride the Bus
MIT assignment.

Track the bus route from MIT to Harvard via bus icons along this map. The map shows a pop-up tag for Harvard's campus and MIT's campus. 

## Implement 
	1.	Fork a Copy of this project to your Github page
	2.	Clone a copy from your Github page to your local work environment
	3.	Open the index file using a browser
	4.	Using the button, start the bus on it's route

## Future improvements
I'd like to add more pop-up features to the map as you travel along the bus route.
