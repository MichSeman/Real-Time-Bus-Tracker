# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
##Ride the Bus
MIT assignment.

Track the bus route from MIT to Harvard via bus icons along this map. The map shows a pop-up tag for Harvard's campus and MIT's campus. 

To implement this code, load the file to your browser. 

Future improvement: I'd like to add more pop-up features to the map as you travel along the bus route.
